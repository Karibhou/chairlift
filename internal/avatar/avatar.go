// Package avatar owns the dinosaur avatar catalog and the illustrations
// bundled for it.
//
// The catalog is the set of dinosaur characters Project Bluefin publishes as
// artwork, transcribed from `projectbluefin/website`'s own
// `src/data/wolves-dinosaur-species.ts`; the illustrations are committed under
// assets/, with their source and revision in assets/NOTICE. It is a pure leaf
// package: no puregotk, no CGO, no GTK, so it is unit-testable on a GTK-less
// host (docs/adr/0007-pure-leaf-packages-route-around-untestable-gtk.md).
//
// Only the catalog and the artwork live here. Decoding the WebP and encoding
// the PNG is internal/avatar's transcoding step, and handing the result to
// AccountsService is the dispatch step; both are separate work, so this
// package deliberately stops at "the bytes the catalog names".

// dinoManifest is the embedded catalog, as `id<TAB>common name<TAB>species<TAB>path`.

// The path is stored literally rather than derived from the ID for the same
// reason internal/livery's CNCF manifest stores it: derivation is wrong often
// enough to matter. `dakotaraptor` lives at `characters/dakota.webp` and
// `kentrosaurus` at `characters/header/katharina.webp`, so a derived
// `<id>.webp` would 404 on both. The common name is stored for the same
// reason: title-casing an ID yields "Bob Torosaurus" where the project writes
// "Bob".
//
// The catalog and the artwork it names are both embedded (embeddedArtworkFS),
// so a pick reads from the binary and no network is involved anywhere in this
